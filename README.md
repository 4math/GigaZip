# GigaZip

A university project in which compression algorithm was realized. We have worked on Deflate which is a combination of Huffman coding and LZ77 (LZSS). 

The project was done in Intellij IDEA 2020.

# Project structure

- [examples](./examples) folder contains examples which were used in benchmarking.
- [slides](./slides) folder contains presentation slides (in Latvian).
- [/src/com/fourmath]([./src/com/fourmath) folder contains all the source files

# Results

Table below presents the results of our compression implementation and Windows built-in zip compression which also uses Deflate. We can clearly see that our implementation compresses less than WinZip from 2 % to 9 %, however, this result was achieved in a shorter amount of time in comparison to WinZip development. All the files can be found in [examples](./examples) folder.

Table below represents the compression and decompression speeds. We can clearly see that compression speed is quite low and it is adequate to compress only small files till 3 - 5 MB. Performance is the problem of our implementation.

# Algorithms - Deflate

We have used Deflate algorithm to compress our data and it consists of 2 algorithm combination - Huffman coding and LZ77 (LZSS).

## Huffman coding

We have used the information from this source: https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/data-compression/lossless/huffman/index.htm to understand and implement the Huffman tree. 

## LZ77 (LZSS)

Deflate also uses LZ77, however, improved version LZSS does not require symbol in a reference and encodes only two values: relative offset and match length. We have implemented 2 versions of encoding, but prefix bit encoding was used in the final version due to its higher compression ratio.  

### Reference encoding

The idea was taken from https://laptrinhx.com/byte-aligned-lz77-compression-3128524495/.

There are 3 types of references:

| Reference name          | 1st byte         | **2nd byte**  | **3rd byte** |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Unique symbol reference | `000`M3-M7       |               |              |
| Short reference         | `001 â€“ 110`R3-R7 | R8-R15        |              |
| Long reference          | `111`M3-M7       | M8-M9 R10-R15 | R16-R23      |

R shows bit indices which are used for offset encoding. M shows bit indices which are used for match length. First 3 bits are used to recognize the type of the reference.

Short reference also use first 3 bits to encode the match length from 3 to 8 where 001 means 3 and 110 - 8. 

Maximum search buffer size is 16384 bytes and maximum look-ahead buffer size is 128 bytes. 

This encoding does not provide the best compression, because buffers are quite small and if there are small number of unique symbols, from 1 to 7 symbols per one unique reference, then there is an overhead. 

### Prefix bit encoding

Second version uses one additional bit to encode whether it is data or a reference. 

Table below shows the encoding of data.

|      | 1st byte       |
| ---- | -------------- |
| 0    | 1 byte of data |

Table below shows the encoding of reference.

|      | 1st byte          | 2nd byte        | 3rd byte        |
| ---- | ----------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1    | match length byte | 1st offset byte | 2nd offset byte |

Maximum search buffer size is 65536 bytes and maximum look-ahead buffer size is 256 bytes.
